                <h4>CSE 121B Final Project</h4>
                <p>
    This Weather Application was developed as the final project for my JavaScript course. 
    The user interface was designed and structured using HTML and CSS, while the core functionality 
    was implemented with JavaScript. The project incorporates fundamental concepts covered during 
    the course, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.  
    A key feature of this application is its integration with an external API 
    (Application Programming Interface) to retrieve real-time weather data. The data is sourced from 
    the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a>, which provides comprehensive 
    meteorological information used to display current weather conditions and forecasts within the app.
